## Knowledge Base RAG Prioritization

This feature prioritizes local knowledge base content over web search results when a knowledge base is active.

### Features

1. **Dedicated Knowledge Search Tool**: When a knowledge base is active, a `knowledge_search` tool is automatically added as the highest priority tool to encourage the AI to check the knowledge base first.

2. **Web Search Enhancement**: The web search tool is wrapped to check the active knowledge base before falling back to a web search, ensuring knowledge base content is prioritized.

3. **Dynamic Tool Configuration**: Tools are automatically reconfigured when a knowledge base is activated or deactivated.

4. **System Prompting**: An extra system message is added to instruct the AI to use the knowledge base for relevant topics.

5. **Semantic Search**: Knowledge base search uses a basic semantic relevance scoring system to find the most pertinent content.

### How it Works

When you activate a knowledge base:

1. The system registers a high-priority `knowledge_search` tool
2. The system wraps the `web_search` tool to check knowledge base content first
3. The AI receives instructions to prefer the knowledge base for relevant topics
4. Search queries first check the knowledge base content before falling back to web search

This ensures that your curated local content is prioritized over generic web content when answering queries.

## MCP Tips

While the system comes with a default echo MCP Server, your LLM can access more powerful tools through MCP. Here's how to get started with two beginner-friendly tools: Fetch and Youtube-dl.

### Quick Setup

Add this JSON configuration to your Souls MCP settings to enable both tools:

```json
 "mcpServers":{
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-fetch",
        "--ignore-robots-txt"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/allowed/files"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    },
    "youtubedl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@kevinwatt/yt-dlp-mcp"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
```

### Using SSE Server for MCP

You can also connect to an external MCP server via SSE (Server-Sent Events). Add this configuration to your Souls MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MCP_SERVER_NAME": {
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "YOUR_SSE_SERVER_URL"
    }
  }
}
```

### Additional Setup for yt-dlp-mcp

yt-dlp-mcp requires the yt-dlp package. Install it based on your operating system:

#### Windows
```bash
winget install yt-dlp
```

#### MacOS
```bash
brew install yt-dlp
```

#### Linux
```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```
